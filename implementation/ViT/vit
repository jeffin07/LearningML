What is attention ?

finding the similarity between existing and new features is called attention
ie, key, value, query
key:vector for features
value:vector for values of feature
query: vector whose value to be found

function used to determine the similarity is scoring function, attention function
eg: dot product weighted dot product
attention(q,k,v) = v.softmax(score(q,k))

self attention:Finding the similarities netween all the features including it self
in self attention q=k=v

in Multi-head attention is simple which have learnable parameters w for k,q,v with n number of heads
at last heads are concatinated and a linear transform

transformers especially vit are better in large data
in vit image are split into patches and converted into embeddings 

self attention blocks replacing CNN ?
